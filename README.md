FaceRekognition using serverless architechture


Facial recognition technology enables the identification or verification of a person from a digital image or video stream. Here's an overview of how you can leverage AWS services to build a facial recognition application:

Frontend (React):

Create a user interface in React to capture user input (e.g., upload an image or grant camera access).
Handle form submissions or button clicks to trigger API calls through API Gateway.
API Gateway:

Act as a single entry point for your backend APIs exposed by Lambda functions.
Define routes (URLs) that map to specific Lambda functions for handling image uploads and recognition requests.
Lambda Functions:

Write serverless functions in Node.js or Python to process incoming API requests.
Use the AWS SDK to interact with other AWS services.
S3 Bucket:

Securely store uploaded images before processing.
Configure access permissions for Lambda functions to retrieve images.
Amazon Rekognition:

A serverless deep learning service that analyzes images and videos to detect faces, identify people in known faces collections, compare faces, and more.
Integrate with your Lambda functions to perform facial recognition tasks.
DynamoDB:

A NoSQL database that efficiently stores facial recognition results and user information (if applicable).
Lambda functions can interact with DynamoDB to query for recognized faces or store data.
